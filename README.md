Database of essential host factors for pathogenic infection

EHFPI, a database of Essential Host Factors (EHFs) for Pathogenic Infections. This database focuses on the collection and functional analysis of a specialized class of host cellular genes identified from (genome-wide) RNA interface (RNAi) screens. Notably, the knockdown effect of these genes greatly influences the infection of a pathogen (e.g., inhibit or increase infection) but not the viability of the host cells, thus designated as essential host factors (EHFs) for pathogenic infections.

Currently, EHFPI contains detailed article, screen, and annotation information for a total of 4634 manually curated EHF genes, with phenotypes validated in Drosophila and Homo sapiens for 25 clinically important pathogen types. Besides the widest coverage, EHFPI also provides as many as six powerful analysis tools with graphic demonstrations, i.e., EHF-pathogen network analysis, EHF overlap analysis, gene enrichment analysis, pathogen interacting protein (PIP) analysis, drug target analysis, and genome-wide association study (GWAS) candidate gene analysis.
